    <h1>üëã Hi, I‚Äôm <a href="https://github.com/AKASHMUTHAIYA">AKASH MUTHIAYA</a></h1>
    <p>üöÄ I developed a <strong>Sports Event Management System</strong> as part of my Full Stack web development journey. This project leverages core technologies such as Java Servlets, JDBC, and SQL integration to provide a seamless platform for managing sports events. It includes functionalities for event management, player registration, audience ticket booking, and more. The aim is to streamline processes and provide an efficient system for event organizers, players, and attendees.</p>
    
    <p>üîß <strong>Core Features of the Project:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Admin Panel:</strong> 
            <p>Admins have the authority to control and manage the system. Key features of the Admin panel include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event Management:</strong> Admins can create, update, or delete events, including information such as event name, date, time, and venue.</li>
                <li><strong>Player Management:</strong> Admins can view and update player details, and manage player registrations for specific events.</li>
                <li><strong>Ticket Sales Monitoring:</strong> Admins can monitor ticket bookings, check availability, and update the number of available tickets for each event.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> The admin section is secured with an authentication system, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the event and player data.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Player Registration:</strong> 
            <p>The player registration system allows athletes to register for events with essential details such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Players provide their name, age, team, and contact details.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Registration:</strong> Players can select the events they wish to participate in, after which their registration details are stored in the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Validation:</strong> The system performs validation to ensure that all required fields are filled and that the provided information is correct (e.g., age cannot be a negative number).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Audience Ticket Booking:</strong>
            <p>This feature allows users (audience members) to book tickets for specific events. The booking flow includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event Viewing:</strong> Audience members can view a list of available events, including details like event names, schedules, and venues.</li>
                <li><strong>Ticket Availability:</strong> The system ensures that users can only book tickets if seats are available for the selected event.</li>
                <li><strong>Booking Confirmation:</strong> After selecting the number of tickets, users can book tickets, and the system provides them with a confirmation along with a ticket number.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Updates:</strong> The system updates ticket availability in real-time, reflecting the bookings made by the users to prevent overbooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>üõ†Ô∏è <strong>Technologies Used in the Project:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Java Servlets:</strong> Java Servlets form the backbone of the application. They handle HTTP requests, process user inputs, and communicate with the backend logic. Servlets are used for:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Handling user actions (admin login, player registration, audience ticket booking).</li>
            <li>Processing business logic such as event creation, player registration, and ticket booking.</li>
            <li>Communicating with the database to retrieve and store data.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):</strong> JDBC is used to connect the Java application to the database. Key functionalities include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Executing SQL queries to interact with the database (INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE).</li>
            <li>Handling database connections and ensuring smooth communication between the application and the relational database.</li>
            <li>Managing transactions and ensuring data integrity throughout user interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>SQL (Structured Query Language):</strong> SQL is used to design and manage the database structure. The main tables include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Players Table:</strong> Contains player-specific information such as name, age, team, and registration status.</li>
            <li><strong>Events Table:</strong> Stores details about each event, including name, date, location, and available tickets.</li>
            <li><strong>Tickets Table:</strong> Tracks ticket bookings made by users, storing information like user details, event, number of tickets, and status.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):</strong> The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies are used to:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Design responsive and user-friendly web pages for both admins and users.</li>
            <li>Implement dynamic and interactive features such as form validation, dynamic ticket booking updates, and event selection.</li>
            <li>Enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback on user actions (e.g., successful registration or ticket booking confirmation).</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>üóÇÔ∏è <strong>Database Structure:</strong>  
        The database is designed to handle relationships between players, events, and tickets. Key tables include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Players Table:</strong> Contains player data such as name, age, team, event registration status, and contact details.</li>
            <li><strong>Events Table:</strong> Stores event-related data, including the event name, date, time, venue, and the number of available tickets.</li>
            <li><strong>Tickets Table:</strong> Keeps track of user ticket bookings, including user information, event selection, and the number of tickets purchased.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>‚ö° <strong>Application Flow:</strong>  
        1. **Admin Login & Management:** Admin logs in, accesses the control panel, and manages event data, including creating or modifying events, players, and ticket information.
        2. **Player Registration:** Players fill in their details and select events for participation, which are stored in the database after validation.
        3. **Audience Ticket Booking:** Audience members select events they wish to attend, choose the number of tickets, and complete the booking process. The system ensures availability and updates the database in real-time.
        4. **Real-Time Data Management:** The database is constantly updated with the latest information regarding event details, player registrations, and ticket bookings, ensuring that no conflicting data is stored.

        Throughout the development of this project, I have deepened my understanding of Full Stack development, especially in areas like database design, back-end logic, and front-end integration. I‚Äôve also strengthened my knowledge of Java-based technologies, including Servlets and JDBC.</p>
    
    <p>üí¨ <strong>Collaboration & Contribution:</strong>  
        I‚Äôm always eager to collaborate with others on similar projects, particularly those that focus on web technologies, database management, and system integration.
